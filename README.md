# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Module one of Data Bootcamp: This is a project to become more familiar with Excel to uncover trends of the data provided for a Kickstarter campaign. Louise is an up and coming playwright that wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever" for around $10,000. She wants to know what is involved with raising money and is looking for guidance on how current treads in the crowdfunding arena are held. We are tasked with the jobs to take a large set of data with multiple parameters to help uncover any hidden trends. The results of what we find can help Louise make decisions on moving her project forward. 
### Purpose. 
The Purpose of this challenge is to not only use the skills we have learned with Excel, but to also investigate information to help Louise make an educated decision. Louise came close to her goal in a short amount of time, but she wants to know how different campaigns faired in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. We will first create a chart based on the launch date and then a chart based on goals. With this final information, the data will be presented in a written form. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first thing we did was look at the outcomes of the campaigns based on Launch dates. Outcomes are either successful, failed, or canceled. See figure 1

Overall successful campaigns had a higher percentage than canceled and failed. All 3 outcomes did follow a similar pattern with 2015 being the peak for all three. 2012 we saw a bump for successful, followed by a slight dip in 2013 before rising again in 2014 and 2015. What happened in 2016? We see the trend of all 3 campaigns fall and drop even further in 2017. Since it is 2020, more data could be collected to see if the trend of the outcomes goes back up. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The next criteria we looked at, was the outcomes based on percentages of goals. See figure 2

In this graph, we see that successful campaigns start 80% when the goal is less than $1000. The percentage rate keeps going down until the goal reaches to the $25-29K goal. Then we see a rise from $30K to around $50K with around 70% of the goals successful. After this we see a dip again until the campaign goal goes over $50K. But even at this amount, we are only seeing 20% success. 

The failed campaigns started around 25% failure when the goal was less than $1000. The failure rate increased to 80% until the goals were around $25-29K. Then is the failure rate decreased to around $35-45K. Then it sharply rose to 100% failed until $45-50K. Over &50K, we then see a drop to 85% failure.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only challenges I personally encountered were the fact that I was thrown off by no campaigns for plays were canceled. I thought my analysis was incorrect but looking at the raw date criteria when I filtered, “plays” and “canceled”, were in fact, zero. 
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
2015 was a year for very successful outcomes but also a year for a lot of failed and cancelled outcomes then other years. It seems to be a synergistic relationship with all 3 outcomes since they follow the same pattern. This data alone illustrates that good comes with the bad. If we need to make a decision based on this graph alone, it results do not look promising.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Some conclusions that can be gained from this analysis, is that more successful campaigns are less than $1000 or more than $35,000. The more money you ask for, the more likely you will reach your goal. But it’s a small window. Either a little bit of money or between $35-45K. If more than $45,000, the percentage of failure increases. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limits of the data set are that there is a small criterion of data that we are looking at. Other factors should be considered to get a better understanding of trends. Is there something going on economically? Are certain types of plays more popular that others? We also cannot see how the marketing campaigns were held as well as getting the word out. Social media? Emails? How the data was collected is also a limitation. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can look at other types of parameters such as the number of backers and the average given per backer. Or even seeing how much was pledged per backer. Even looking at how long the campaign lasted for would be a good parameter to look at.
